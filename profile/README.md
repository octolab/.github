We are a developer-centric community of open-source enthusiasts.
Our mission is to identify the unique needs during development and
find the most fitting solutions for them.

## Solution discovery

🔭 Our journey of discovery is thoroughly documented [here][Octospot].
The finest open-source solutions we've encountered are curated
at [awesomenoss!][] For those challenges if we haven't found
an existing solution, we create our own and share them with everyone.

## Automation

🤖 We have a distaste for repetition, especially in mundane tasks.
In [this project][Octomation], we've compiled everything related to
the automation of routine tasks and the templating of approaches and
solutions.

## Product development

🎁 We also focus on developing human-centric products to enhance
our users' quality of life. You can explore our product sandbox
[here][Octopods]. Our experimental endeavors are housed in separate
organizations: [LifeOS][], [Sparkle][], and [Tact][].
